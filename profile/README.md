# Getting Started

See the [Virtool documentation](https://www.virtool.ca/docs/legacy/manual/start/installation) to get started with the latest
version of Virtool 4.

## Versions

Virtool is currently undergoing a major transformation into a cloud-native application. This will mean Virtool can scale
work across multiple hosts and run natively in Kubernetes and public cloud providers.

**Virtool 4 series should be used for now**. This version will continue to receive bug and security fixes for the forseeable future.

Virtool 5 and later will comprise multiple containerized services that need to run together. A deployment and migration guide will be provided.
