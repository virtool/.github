# Important

**Virtool container images will no longer be published to Dockerhub starting March 31, 2023**.

Ensure you are pulling images from the GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`).


# Getting Started

See the [Virtool documentation](https://www.virtool.ca/docs/manual/start/installation/) to get started with the latest
version of Virtool 4.

# Versions

Virtool is currently undergoing a major transformation into a cloud-native application. This will mean Virtool can scale
work across multiple hosts and run natively in Kubernetes and public cloud providers.

**Virtool 4 series should be used for now**. This version will continue to receive bug and security fixes for the forseeable future.

Virtool 5 and later will comprise multiple containerized services that need to run together. A deployment and migration guide will be provided.

# Issues

[Create an issue on Github](https://github.com/virtool/virtool/issues) to report bugs, request features, make suggestions, or ask questions.
